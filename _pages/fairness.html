<p>I regularly compile <strong>Fairness in Machine Learning Flashcards </strong> in which I break down key concepts from the literature on algorithmic bias into a handy and concise format. You can download all flash cards in high resolution <a href="https://github.com/Lion-Be/Lion-Be.github.io/blob/master/files/fairness_flashcards.zip">here</a>.</p>
