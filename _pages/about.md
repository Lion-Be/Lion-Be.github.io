<strong>Welcome to my website!</strong>
</font>
</font>
I am data scientist, statistician and ex-social science researcher in the field of Anti-Financial Crime. Currently, I lead a [project](https://spotixx.com/beyond-accuracy-responsible-and-ethically-sound-ai-with-transfair/) at the Frankfurt-based AI startup [spotixx](www.spotixx.com) on fair and explainable machine learning models for financial services. Together with [Paul C. Bauer](https://www.stat.lmu.de/soda/en/team/contact-page/paul-bauer-a8dab35c.html) and [Denis Cohen](https://denis-cohen.github.io/), I am writing a book on *Applied Causal Inference with R*, in which we connect traditional approaches to causal estimation with cutting-edge methods from causal machine learning. I am also an active content creator on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lion-be/) where I regularly blog and post about topics around fairness in machine learning, explainable AI and the intersection between statistical approaches and modern prediction modeling. 

Formerly, I have been working as a Data Science Consultant at a large German bank dealing with machine learning pipelines for anti money laundering transaction monitoring. I hold a M.Sc. degree in Methodology and Statistics from the [University of Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en) and a Dr.rer.soc. on *Statistical Detection of Systematic Election Irregularities* from the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/).

<strong>December 2023 </strong> 
</font> **I taught the workshop "AI in Anti Financial Crime" at [Sopra Steria](https://www.soprasteria.de/)'s Graduate Program of Risk, Finance & Compliance in Hamburg**
<br>
The workshop introduced a group of FinCrime professionals to the landscape of different AI approaches, discussed their possibility to tackle every-day problems within Anti Financial Crime Operations, and highlighted a hands-on use case on machine learning-based customer segmentation in Transaction Monitoring.
