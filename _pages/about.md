<strong>Welcome to my website!</strong>
</font>
</font>
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

<strong>December 2023 </strong> 
</font> **I taught the workshop "AI in Anti Financial Crime" at [Sopra Steria](https://www.soprasteria.de/)'s Graduate Program of Risk, Finance & Compliance in Hamburg**
<br>
The workshop introduced a group of FinCrime professionals to the landscape of different AI approaches, discussed their possibility to tackle every-day problems within Anti Financial Crime Operations, and highlighted a hands-on use case on machine learning-based customer segmentation in Transaction Monitoring.
