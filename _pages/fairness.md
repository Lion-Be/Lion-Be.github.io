I regularly compile **Fairness in Machine Learning Flashcards** in which I break down key concepts from the literature on algorithmic bias into a handy yet concise format. You can download all flash cards in high resolution [here](https://github.com/Lion-Be/Lion-Be.github.io/blob/master/files/fairness_flashcards.zip).
