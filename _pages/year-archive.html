<img src="/images/blog_why_unfair.png" style="max-width: 500px; width: 100%; float: left;"> Algorithmic bias is an inherent challenge in machine learning models, particularly in high-stakes applications like credit approval, where fairness is critical. 
In this blog post, I identify four key sources of bias in AI models:
- Bias in Human Decisions: Models trained on biased historical data may replicate discriminatory patterns.
- Proxy Attributes: Even without explicit sensitive data, indirect variables like geographic location can encode sensitive attributes, perpetuating bias.
- Sample Selection Bias: Disparities in data representation can skew outcomes, favoring majority groups.
- Algorithmic Objectives: Optimization processes focusing on majority group accuracy may lead to poor performance for minorities.
